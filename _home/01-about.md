# About


I am 23 years old and live in Prague,
where I study computer science at the 
[Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/),
and jazz piano at the
[Jaroslav Ježek Conservatory](https://www.kjj.cz).


During my bachelor's studies, I focused on machine learning, particularly [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) models.
I wrote my thesis on the knot-theoretical properties of spatially embedded complete graphs.
I've also been experimenting with some [Quantum Computing](https://github.com/patztablook22/jaq). I did a plenty of C++.

I play the piano a lot. Occasionally I perform in public. 
My favourite pianists are
[Esbjörn Svensson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbj%C3%B6rn_Svensson)
and 
[Brad Mehldau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Mehldau). I also enjoy Baroque music, especially Bach.
Sometimes I reharmonize songs and compose for the trio.

I like Haskell and fractals.
