<h1 style="font-size: 250%">ABOUT</h1>


I am 22 years old. Currently I live in Prague,
where I study Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/).


I focus on neural networks, especially [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) models.
In the future, I would like to
work on the potental creation of Artificial General Intelligence,
possibly with inspirations in the biological brain. 
I've been also experimenting with [Quantum Computing](https://github.com/patztablook22/jaq) lately.

I practice a lot of jazz piano. Occasionally I perform in public. 
I listen mostly to modern Scandinavian jazz and ECM/ACT records.
My favourite pianists are
[Esbj√∂rn Svensson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbj%C3%B6rn_Svensson)
and 
[Brad Mehldau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Mehldau).
Sometimes I reharmonize songs, and I have also done some composing.

I like fractals.
