title: "ETRA 2019 challenge report"
abstract: "Positional eye-tracking data from the ETRA 2019 challenge dataset is analyzed to check for one-to-one search correspondence in puzzle type experiments and for heterogeneities of visual attention with respect to the target area color. For puzzle compared to non-puzzle image types, left image attention is found to be a significant predictor of the right image attention, suggesting one-to-search search patterns. The observed color heterogeneities, e.g. RGB red or HSV value are discussed."
