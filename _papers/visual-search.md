title:  "Visual search experiment report"
abstract: "This report lays out the basics of visual search and 
the evaluation of its perfomance. Participants were asked
to take a short visual search test. The reaction time slope
was found to be significantly larger when the target is absent 
and when a conjunction of multiple features is being
considered. Discussion of the results is given.
