title:  "Face mask detection using one-stage and two-stage CNNs"

abstract: "
Multiple models have been trained on the WIDER FACE and MASKED FACE datasets. A two-stage CNN model has been
trained separately on the two datasets, and used to enhance the MASKED FACE dataset. Further, one-stage YOLO detectors have
been trained on the concatenation of the two datasets, with either the original or the enhanced MASKED FACE version. Both
one-stage variants perform similarly well and outperform the two-stage model. The advantages and disadvantages of all approaches
are discussed.
