Multiple models have been trained on the WIDER FACE and MASKED FACE datasets. A two-stage CNN model has been
trained separately on the two datasets, and used to enhance the MASKED FACE dataset. Further, one-stage YOLO detectors have
been trained on the concatenation of the two datasets, with either the original or the enhanced MASKED FACE version. Both
one-stage variants perform similarly well and outperform the two-stage model. The advantages and disadvantages of all approaches
are discussed.

I do not want to paint myself, nor do I consider myself, to be
paranoid towards the current world, despite occasionally
thinking I should be. The majority of my concern is not in the trust towards it,
but towards the potential future worlds inheriting technology that makes
centralized power eaiser.

Caught up in my thoughts, I gazed   
out into the night, amazed,        
by what I saw and what I thought:
lonely stars, each by dreams is fraught.

They're straight across, and far below.
Whose is it? I'll never know.
And even if I went and sought,
there is no change to what's been wrought.

Their light is calm, others' shaking,
I see them coupled, I see them breaking,
some looking up, catching a glimpse
of the other stargazer's dreams:

faceless
little
helpless
free

the light fills them with serenity
only the night can show.
