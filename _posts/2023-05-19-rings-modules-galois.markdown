A (commutative, unital) ring is the 3-tuple \\( (R, +, \\cdot) \\) such that
\\( (R, +) \\) is an Abelian group, \\( (R, \\cdot) \\) is a commutative monoid,
and the two satisfy mutually distributive laws. 
An \\( R \\)-module is an Abelian group tied to a scalar multiplication ring \\( R \\),
satisfying mutual distributivite laws and multiplicative compatibility.
