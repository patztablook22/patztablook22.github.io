A (commutative, unital) ring is the 3-tuple \\( (R, +, \\cdot) \\) such that
\\( (R, +) \\) is an Abelian group, \\( (R, \\cdot) \\) is a commutative monoid,
and the two satisfy mutually distributive laws. \\( S \\subset R \\) is a 
subring of \\( R \\) if there exists a ring morphism \\(R \\to S \\). An
ideal \\(I \\subset R \\) is a additive subgroup of \\( R \\) that absorbs
all multiplication: \\( \\forall i \\in I, r \\in R: ir \\in R \\).

The coursework consisted of a set of exercises exploring the three, and
the links between them.
