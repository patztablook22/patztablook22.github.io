In Euclidean data clustering, we seek to assign input data points into clusters, such that the maximum distance between points within the same cluster is 
minimized (or alternatively, such that the maximum distance between points from their cluster's center is minimized). Through various reductions of graph
problems (\\(k\\)-coloring, vertex cover), it is possible to show that not only is this task in \\(\ge 3\\) dimensions NP-complete, but also its approximations are NP-complete. Our
aim in this project will be to improve known approximation factors for NP-completeness or polynomial complexity.

<i><b>Def.</b></i> Let \\((X, \text{dist})\\) be a metric space and \\(C \subset X\\). Define
\\[ \text{diam}(C) := \text{max } \\{ \text{dist}(x,y)  \mid  x, y \in C \\}. \\]

<i><b>Def.</b></i> Further, for a collection of subsets \\(C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k \subset X \\),
\\[ \text{diam}(\\{C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k\\}) := \text{max } \\{ \text{dist}(x, y)  \mid  i \in [k] \;\; \& \;\;  x, y \in C_i \\}. \\]


<b>Max-\\(k\\)-Diameter</b> - let \\((X, \text{dist})\\) be a metric space and let \\(k\\) be a constant. Given as input \\(P \subset X\\), find a \\(k\\)-clustering 
that minimizes \\(\text{diam}(\\{C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k\\})\\).

<b>\\(r\\)-approximate Max-\\(k\\)-Diameter</b> - given \\((X, \text{dist})\\), \\(k\\), and input \\(P \subset X\\), let 
\\(\Delta := \text{min }\text{diam}(\\{C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k\\})\\) over all possible clusterings of \\(P\\). 
Find a \\(k\\)-clustering with diameter at most \\(r\Delta\\).
