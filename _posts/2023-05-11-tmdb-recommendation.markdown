A modular movie recommendation algorithm for the TMDB 5000 dataset was designed, with a number of content-based
feature pipelines. The features used range from very simple, such as rescaled numerical data or document TF-IDF, to deep-learning
hidden states (BERT). All pipilines are found to be significantly better than random recommendations. Deep-learning and
classical-learning based features perform similarly well. Advantages and limitations are discussed.
