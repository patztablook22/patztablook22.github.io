Consider a finite set of vertices \\(V\\) and suppose that we only know distances 
between some of
them. In other words, consider a random graph \\( G \\) over \\(V\\) and a function
\\(d: E(G) \to \mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{0\}\\).
What properties of \\(G\\) 
make it possible to uniquely reconstruct the configuration of \\(V\\)
(up to isometry)?
We will show that the minimum degree \\(\ge 2\\)
is alone sufficient with high probability.
