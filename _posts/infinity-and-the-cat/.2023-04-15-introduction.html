series: Infinity and the Cat

<p>
Category theory is a branch of mathematics that has become renowed for 
a seemingly occult level of abstraction. 
It's caught the minds of many who see and seek the beauty in mathematics.
<br />
<br />
In this series of posts, I shall attempt to lay out an understandable, 
yet formally rigorous, introduction to category theory.

This article is work in progress!

<p>
To make things as <s>painful</s> challenging for me as possible,
the prerequisite to the series is <b>only a decent college-level mathematics</b>.
However, I hope to engage the intellect of a knowledgable university 
student too.
</p>

<p>
Throughout this series, I will be using English, and,
even at unexpected times, mathematical logic, and various diagrams. 
I make no distinction between those, as they are all just different languages,
some more suitable in certain contexts than others.
Yet, I will attempt to make the series as linear and story-like as a book.

<h2>History and motivations</h2>

<p>
During the 20th century, mathematics has undergone perhaps the greatest
transformation in history. The same way zero wasn't understood by the
ancient Summerians, Romans, or Arabs, the humankind was unaware of
the existence of multiple infinities for the long centuries to come. 
For example, given
the natural numbers, the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers:

\begin{align}
\mathbb{N} &= \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\} \\
\mathbb{Z} &= \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\} \\
\mathbb{Q} &= \left\{-\frac{1}{2}, 0, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{4}{6}, 3, ...\right\} \\
\mathbb{R} &= \left\{..., -19.3, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, 0.1, \pi, ...\right\}, \\
\end{align}

One would say all of sets have the same size of \( \infty \). They are
not finite. So they must be infinite.
</p>

<p>
It was George Cantor, who first showed there is an enormous diversity
of infinities. In fact, there is no less of them than the natural numbers 
themselves!
</p>

<p>
A key problem is in how should we determine whether one set is larger
than another. 
For a simple warm-up let's formulate our first theorem.
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<b>Theorem 1.</b>
\( |\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{Q}| \). Rather underwhelming, right?
    <div class="proof">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        asdfsd
    </div>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, the real numbers are strictly larger than natural numbers,
and, in turn, also larger than the rational numbers!
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<b>Theorem 2.</b>
\( |\mathbb{R}| > |\mathbb{N}| \).

    <div class="proof">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        asdfsd
    </div>
</div>

<p>
Ok ok cool. But let's go a bit further, a bit more general. 
Given any set \( S \), let's
find another set, that is guaranteed to be strictly larger than \( S \).
That way, we could iterate this process of finding greater and greater
sets and infinitum.
</p>

<p>
As we have seen in \( \mathbb{Z} \) vs. \( \mathbb{N} \), simply "doubling"
the elements (or in fact simply N-copying) the elements doesn't help. 
Allowing us to even multply the number of items by of a set by itself
won't help too, as witnessed by the poor little \( \mathbb{Q} \).
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the power set? The set containing all subsets of \( S \)?

<div class="definition">
    <b>Definition.</b> \( \mathcal{P}(S) = \{ R \subset S \} \).
    <br />
    <br />

    E.g. \( \mathcal{P}(\{1, 2, 3\}) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\},
    \{1, 2\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\} \} \).


    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Notation.</b> \( 2^S = \mathcal{P}(S) \).
    This results in the elegant statement that, so far for finite sets,
    \[
        |2^S| = 2^|S|.
    \]
</div>

It turns out this is just right. To prove that, we will use a more
general version of Cantor's real number argument:

<div class="theorem">
<b>Theorem (Cantor's theorem).</b>
\( |\mathcal{P}(S)| > |S| \).

    <div class="proof">
        <i>Proof.</i>
        asdfsd
    </div>
</div>

Now this is truly revolutionary. This means, we can now take the smallest
infinite set we know of - the natural numbers, and recursively get
larger and larger and larger sets! Look!
</p>

\begin{align}
    S_0 &= \mathbb{N} \\
    S_1 &= 2^{S_0} = 2^\mathbb{N} \\
    S_2 &= 2^{S_1} = 2^{2^\mathbb{N}} \\
    S_3 &= 2^{S_2} = 2^{2^{2^\mathbb{N}}} \\
    & \hspace{3mm} \vdots \\
    S_{n+1} &=  2^{S_n}
\end{align}

<p>
The sizes of these sets are so important they have a name. We call them
aleph zero (aleph is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet), aleph one, 
aleph two, etc.:

<div class="definition">
    <b>Definition.</b>
    \begin{align}
        \aleph_0 &= |\mathbb{N}| \\
        \aleph_1 &= 2^{\aleph_0} = 2^{|\mathbb{N}|} \\
        \aleph_2 &= 2^{\aleph_1} = 2^{2^{|\mathbb{N}|}} \\
        \aleph_3 &= 2^{\aleph_2} = 2^{2^{2^{|\mathbb{N}|}}} \\
        & \hspace{3mm} \vdots \\
        \aleph_{n+1} &=  2^{\aleph_n}
    \end{align}
</div>

</p>
