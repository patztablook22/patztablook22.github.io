minimized (or alternatively, such that the maximum distance between points from their cluster’s center is minimized). Through various reductions of graph
problems (\(k\)-coloring, vertex cover), it is possible to show that not only is this task in \(\ge 3\) dimensions NP-complete, but also its approximations are NP-complete. Our
aim in this project will be to improve known approximation factors for NP-completeness or polynomial complexity.</p>

<p><i><b>Def.</b></i> Let \((X, \text{dist})\) be a metric space and \(C \subset X\). Define
\[ \text{diam}(C) := \text{max } \{ \text{dist}(x,y)  \mid  x, y \in C \}. \]</p>

<p><i><b>Def.</b></i> Further, for a collection of subsets \(C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k \subset X \),
\[ \text{diam}(\{C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k\}) := \text{max } \{ \text{dist}(x, y)  \mid  i \in [k] \;\; \&amp; \;\;  x, y \in C_i \}. \]</p>

<p><b>Max-\(k\)-Diameter</b> - let \((X, \text{dist})\) be a metric space and let \(k\) be a constant. Given as input \(P \subset X\), find a \(k\)-clustering 
that minimizes \(\text{diam}(\{C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k\})\).</p>

<p><b>\(r\)-approximate Max-\(k\)-Diameter</b> - given \((X, \text{dist})\), \(k\), and input \(P \subset X\), let 
\(\Delta := \text{min }\text{diam}(\{C_1, C_2, \dots, C_k\})\) over all possible clusterings of \(P\). 
Find a \(k\)-clustering with diameter at most \(r\Delta\).</p>
