      <h2><a href="/2023/05/26/fighting-action-recognition.html">Fighting action recognition</a></h2>
      
      <p>Several fighting action classifiers based on RGB-D videos were developed. The Motion History Images (MHIs) and Motion
Energy Images (MEIs) were extracted and used together with SIFT bag-of-words (BoW) features. Both shallow neural netwoks and
SVMs were outperformed by the KNN. Lastly, deep neural networks using both 2D and 3D convolution have been trained directly on
the RGB-D videos and the MHI + MEI motion silhouettes. The 3D-2D CNN significantly outperformed all classical models and the 2D
MHI + MEI CNN. The MHI + MEI silhouettes are argued to insufficiently capture the relevant information compared to “trainable deep
motion silhouettes” extracted by the 3D-2D CNN. The SIFT based BoW is argued not to be suited the partial body movement actions.
Performance-efficient CNN alternatives are proposed.</p>

      <p>A (commutative, unital) ring is the 3-tuple \( (R, +, \cdot) \) such that
\( (R, +) \) is an Abelian group, \( (R, \cdot) \) is a commutative monoid,
and the two satisfy mutually distributive laws. 
An \( R \)-module is an Abelian group tied to a scalar multiplication ring \( R \),
satisfying mutual distributivite laws and multiplicative compatibility.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/05/11/tmdb-recommendation.html">Deep-learning movie recommendation</a></h2>
      
      <p>A modular movie recommendation algorithm for the TMDB 5000 dataset was designed, with a number of content-based
feature pipelines. The features used range from very simple, such as rescaled numerical data or document TF-IDF, to deep-learning
hidden states (BERT). All pipilines are found to be significantly better than random recommendations. Deep-learning and
classical-learning based features perform similarly well. Advantages and limitations are discussed.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/05/11/face-mask-detection.html">Face mask detection using one-stage and two-stage CNNs</a></h2>
      
      <p>Multiple models have been trained on the WIDER FACE and MASKED FACE datasets. A two-stage CNN model has been
trained separately on the two datasets, and used to enhance the MASKED FACE dataset. Further, one-stage YOLO detectors have
been trained on the concatenation of the two datasets, with either the original or the enhanced MASKED FACE version. Both
one-stage variants perform similarly well and outperform the two-stage model. The advantages and disadvantages of all approaches
are discussed.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/03/20/quantum-computing-with-jaq.html">Quantum computing with Jaq</a></h2>
      
      <p>Jaq is a Quantum computing engine for Java that focuses on usage simplicity
and modularity. It provides an abstraction of a quantum computer, the
Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM). Quantum circuits can be then run indpedendently
of the underlying QVM implementation. I have written a quantum computer
simulator that uses sparse linear algebra.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/03/13/rings-and-ideals.html">Rings, subrings, and ideals</a></h2>
      
      <p>A (commutative, unital) ring is the 3-tuple \( (R, +, \cdot) \) such that
\( (R, +) \) is an Abelian group, \( (R, \cdot) \) is a commutative monoid,
and the two satisfy mutually distributive laws. \( S \subset R \) is a 
subring of \( R \) if there exists a ring morphism \(R \to S \). An
ideal \(I \subset R \) is a additive subgroup of \( R \) that absorbs
all multiplication: \( \forall i \in I, r \in R: ir \in R \).</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/03/09/visual-search-experiment.html">Visual search experiment</a></h2>
      
      <p>This report lays out the basics of visual search and 
the evaluation of its perfomance. Participants were asked
to take a short visual search test. The reaction time slope
was found to be significantly larger when the target is absent 
and when a conjunction of multiple features is being
considered. Discussion of the results is given.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/03/09/etra-2019.html">ETRA 2019 challenge report</a></h2>
      
      <p>Positional eye-tracking data from the ETRA 2019 challenge dataset is analyzed 
to check for <em>one-to-one</em>
search correspondence in <em>puzzle</em> type experiments and for heterogeneities
of visual attention with respect to the target area color. For <em>puzzle</em>
compared to <em>non-puzzle</em> image types, left image attention
is found to be a significant predictor of the right image attention,
suggesting one-to-search search patterns. The observed color heterogeneities,
e.g. RGB red or HSV value are discussed.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/02/10/tensor-arithmetic-with-matcha.html">Tensor arithmetic with Matcha</a></h2>
      
      <p>In my first university year, I was motivated by the lectures of Milan Straka,
an amazing teacher at MFF, to delve (deeper than I should have, in retrospect)
into the lower-levels of machine learning. Due to being a sperger when it comes
to blackboxes, I decided to start implementing my own Numpy/Tensorflow, fully
in C++, which I am going to introduce in this post.</p>
