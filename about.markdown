# I am

<div id="i-am-text">
<p>
... a 21 y/o Artificial Intelligence student from Liberec, Czechia. Currently, I live in Prague,
where I study at the <a href="https://www.mff.cuni.cz/">Department of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I focus on machine learning, especially on artificial neural networks. I also learn about the biological brain.
In the future, I would like to use state-of-the-art machine learning for exploring the brain. I am also interested
in biologically-inspired artifical intelligence, and the potental creation of artificial general intelligence.
</p>

<p>
I practice a lot of jazz piano. Occasionally I perform in public. My favourite pianist
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbj%C3%B6rn_Svensson">Esbj√∂rn Svensson</a>. 
Sometimes I reharmonize songs, and I have also done some composing.
I prefer playing in a band to solo-playing. This is both my way to relax and my passionate long-time endeavour.
</p>

<p>
I like fractals.
